3. Register Content of Capstone Project
3.1. Capstone Project Name
English: University Academic Platform on Blockchain (UAP Blockchain)
Vietnamese: Xây dựng hệ thống quản lý học tập và xác thực bằng cấp trên nền tảng Blockchain.
Abbreviation: UAP Blockchain

a. Context
The traditional method of managing and verifying academic records such as transcripts, degrees, and certificates is slow, costly, and heavily reliant on paper-based documentation. This approach exposes several risks including data forgery, inefficiency, and lack of transparency for both universities and employers.
In addition, universities require not only secure credential verification but also a comprehensive academic management system that supports:
Class enrollment and management.


Attendance tracking.


Recording and updating grades.


Managing student progress and graduation eligibility.


Goal:
 This project aims to leverage Ethereum Quorum, a permissioned blockchain, to create a tamper-proof, transparent, and scalable academic management platform.
 The system ensures that all learning activities, grades, and credentials are stored immutably on-chain, while non-sensitive data is cached off-chain for performance optimization.

b. Proposed Solution
On-chain (Blockchain Layer)
Smart Contracts (Solidity on Ethereum Quorum) implement the following key functions:
issueCredential(studentId, credentialData) – Issue certificates to students who meet graduation requirements.


revokeCredential(credentialId) – Revoke certificates in cases of error, fraud, or academic misconduct.


markAttendance(studentId, classId, date, status) – Record attendance data on-chain.


updateGrade(studentId, courseId, score) – Allow teachers to record or update student grades on-chain.


updateUserWallet(studentId, newWallet) – Allow wallet updates if a private key is lost.


Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):
Admin: System-wide management, credential issuance and revocation, user and role management.


Teacher: Class management, attendance marking, and grade updates.


Student: View transcripts, re-enroll in courses, and generate verifiable certificates.


Employer (Third Party): Verify academic credentials through a free verification portal (no gas or access fees).


Event Emission:
 Smart contracts emit key events (CredentialIssued, Revoked, GradeUpdated, AttendanceMarked) to synchronize data between blockchain and off-chain services.

Off-chain (Hybrid Architecture)
Backend API (ASP.NET Core):
Acts as a bridge between the user interface and blockchain nodes.


Handles authentication (JWT for Admin/Teacher and MetaMask for Students).


Stores temporary records in the database as Pending until blockchain confirmation.


Database (SQL Server):
Stores user profiles, class information, and cached blockchain events.


Ensures atomic synchronization — data is only finalized when the blockchain transaction is confirmed.


Event Listener Service:
Subscribes to blockchain events via WebSocket or RPC.


Handles blockchain node failures by implementing a retry queue and resynchronization once the node recovers.


Guarantees fault tolerance and data consistency between blockchain and database.



Frontend & Dashboards
Technology Stack: React (TypeScript) + Ethers.js + MetaMask/WalletConnect
Portals and User Roles:
Admin Portal: Manage users, roles, classes, issue and revoke credentials, view reports.


Teacher Portal: Manage class rosters, mark attendance, record or correct grades (by creating new immutable transactions instead of overwriting).


Student Portal: View academic records, register for re-enrollment, and generate verifiable QR codes/links for employers.


Employer (Verification) Portal: Verify certificates or grades in real time through QR codes or credential IDs without requiring a blockchain wallet.



c. Functional Requirements
Authentication & Authorization
Supports role-based access control (RBAC).


MFA for Admin and Teacher roles.


MetaMask/WalletConnect login for blockchain-based authentication.


Credential Management
Admins issue and revoke credentials.


Credentials have immutable states: Draft → Issued → Revoked.


Each issuance and revocation is permanently stored on-chain and auditable.


Class & Attendance Management
Teachers can assign students to classes and mark attendance.


Attendance data is logged immutably on-chain for transparency.


Grade Management
Teachers update student grades for quizzes, midterms, and finals.


Incorrect entries are rectified by adding new transactions (no overwriting).


The system aggregates all components to determine passing or failing results.


Re-enrollment & Eligibility Checking
Students who fail can re-enroll via assignClass().


The system automatically checks if a student meets all grade requirements (e.g., quiz ≥ 40%, midterm ≥ 20%, final ≥ 40%, attendance ≥ 75%).


When all conditions are satisfied, the system emits an event EligibleForCertificate(studentId) signaling that the student qualifies for credential issuance.


Instant Verification
Employers can instantly verify credential validity via a web portal (QR code or credential ID).


Verification is read-only and incurs no transaction cost.


Data Synchronization
Off-chain API and on-chain data are synchronized through event listeners.


Operations are atomic: only marked as “Confirmed” in the database after blockchain confirmation.



d. Non-functional Requirements
Security:
End-to-end encryption of sensitive data.


Hashing, signatures, and ACLs enforced by Ethereum Quorum’s permissioned model.


Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for privileged roles.


Key recovery through admin wallet reassignment (updateUserWallet()).


Performance:
Cached queries allow verification results to be retrieved in under 2 seconds.


Scalable horizontally for thousands of students, classes, and credentials.


Reliability & Fault Recovery:
Event Listener includes retry and reconciliation mechanisms for node failure.


Database rollback ensures no inconsistent state during partial transactions.


Usability:
Responsive user interfaces for web and mobile devices.


Intuitive dashboard layouts tailored to each role.


Maintainability:
Modular, microservice-friendly architecture for independent updates.


Comprehensive documentation for APIs, database schema, and contracts.



e. Future Scalability
Mobile Applications: Native apps for Android and iOS to allow students and teachers to access data anytime.


Student CV Builder: Enables students to generate blockchain-verified CVs that include verifiable links to degrees, certificates, and grades.


AI-based Academic Insights: Use analytics to recommend re-enrollment or course improvements.


Integration with External Education Systems: Provide APIs for other institutions to connect and verify data cross-chain.



3.2. Main Proposal Content (Including Result and Product)
Market Research & Analysis: Overview of blockchain and smart contracts applications in education.


System Architecture Design: High-level architecture, ERD, API specifications, security architecture, and data flow.


Technology Stack Justification: Selection rationale for React, .NET Core, SQL Server, and Ethereum Quorum.


Business Model: Free verification portal for third parties; optional enterprise APIs for partner institutions.


Risk Management: Handling of incorrect data input, synchronization errors, lost private keys, and node downtime.


Testing Strategy: Unit testing, integration testing, user acceptance, and performance testing.


Deployment & Operations: CI/CD pipeline, Dockerized deployment, monitoring, and rollback policies.


Deliverables: Source code, documentation, API guide, architecture diagrams, deployable Docker containers, and demo video.
